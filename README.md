#### ** An Android application to manage users and give them shopping discounts **
###### Managers of businesses related to the sale of goods or service providers can register their users and provide an invitation code to that customer or user in each sale or service, after receiving the salary and cost of that work.
###### By registering another user with the code given by the primary user, and registering the purchase, that primary user receives points and can benefit from a discount on the next purchase.
###### The higher the user's score, the more discount the seller can give him.
